# TDD With Django Workshop

Code from the TDD with Django Workshop. Code is based on [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQjmz9wCjLA) and on the [handout included in this repo](./handout/).

This basically covers the first 5 chapters of the (Test-Driven Development with Python)[http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/] book.

The project is a To-Do list app.
